# The Question
A friend asked a good question when I showed him this. "Why can't the machine do this for me?" He envisioned a scenario where he decided there would be a certian syntax to his scripts. Wouldn't a computer be able to remove the work in that case?

The problem is we're so rarely in that case! If we want to accomodate all the ways writers make scripts, we have to help it out. 

But I think we'll get better at this. Each script well parsed could be a data point that teaches the machine more of what's going on here!
